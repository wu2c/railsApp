bug2:
should have a column called 'salt' in create_users table

mistake1:
encrypt1: using salt and encrypt given by Bcrypt
encrypt2: has_secure_password with password_digest and authenticate

now the current app uses both.

mistake2:
newarticles table has a column 'name', which should be the same as users table. 
but now in the newarticles controller, need to assign user's email to name.
So later, the user need to log in first before create newsarticle; only the owner can edit, update, and destroy.

problme1: can't test ssl with https:// in localhost.

users for testing:
